## Sentence Transformers: Multilingual Sentence Embeddings using BERT / RoBERTa / XLM-RoBERTa & Co. with PyTorch

This framework provides an easy method to compute dense vector representations for sentences and paragraphs (also known as sentence embeddings). The models are based on transformer networks like [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) / RoBERTa / XLM-RoBERTa etc. and are tuned specificially meaningul sentence embeddings such that sentences with similar meanings are close in vector space.

## Required Software
* Recommended **Python 3.6** or higher
* **Sentence-Transformer library**
     * **Install with pip**
       * pip install -U sentence-transformers
     * **Alternatively, you can also clone the latest version from the [repository](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) and install it directly from the source code**
* **PyTorch with CUDA**
      * If you want to use a GPU / CUDA, you must install PyTorch with the matching CUDA Version. Follow
[PyTorch - Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for further details how to install PyTorch.
